### Requirements ###

* [NVIDIA Modern GPU](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) (compute capability >= 3.0): Kerpler, Maxwell, Pascal architectures.
* [CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) v7.5 or greater. (CUDA toolkit v8.0 recommended, CUDA toolkit v7.0 supported but not tested)
* GCC or [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org) host compiler with support for C++11<sup>*</sup>.
* [CMake](https://cmake.org) v3.5 or greater.
* 64-bit Operating System (Ubuntu tested).

<sup>*The next release will support C++14 (CUDA Toolkit v8.5). </sup>

### Quick start ###

The following basic steps are required to build and execute cuStinger:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FedericoUnivr/cuStinger
cd cuStinger/build
cmake ..
make -j
./cuStingerTest <input_graph> <options>
```

The syntax and the input parameters of cuStinger are explained in details in the
 `docs/Syntax.txt` file or by typing `./cuStingerTest --help`.

### Supported graph formats ###

cuStinger supports the following graph input formats:

* Market (.mtx), [The University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection](http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/matrices/)
* Metis (.graph), [10th DIMACS Implementation Challenge](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/dimacs10/)
* SNAP (.txt), [Stanford Network Analysis Project](http://snap.stanford.edu/)
* Dimacs9th (.gr), [9th DIMACS Implementation Challenge](http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/challenge9/)
* The Koblenz Network Collection (out.< name >), [The Koblenz Network Collection](http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/)
* Network Data Repository (.edges), [Network Data Repository](http://networkrepository.com/index.php)
* Binary (.bin)

cuStinger directly deduces the graph structure (directed/undirected) from the input file header.

cuStinger allows reading the input graph by using a fixed binary format to speed up the file loading.
The binary file is generated by cuStinger with the `--binary` command line option.

### Code Documentation ###

The code documentation is located in the `docs` directory (*doxygen* html format).
The documentation is also accessible online [**here**.](https://federicounivr.github.io/cuStinger/)

### Notes ###

* The changelog can be found here: [history](docs/History.md)
* cuStinger has been written by adopting (when possible) the following coding styles:
    * [LLVM Coding Standards](http://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html)
    * [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
* cuStinger has been checked with the following tools to ensure the code quality:
    * [clang++ v4.0: warnings](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/DiagnosticsReference.html)
    * [clang-tidy](http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/): warnings and code styles
* cuStinger has been tested with the following tools: (see [`CodeCheck`](docs/CodeCheck.md)
    * [cuda-memcheck](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-memcheck/)
    * [valgrind v3.12](http://valgrind.org/)
    * [clang static analyzer v279](https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/)

### Additional Utilities ###

* `util/count_lines.sh` : some statistics about cuStinger code.
* `util/uf_graph_download.sh` : simple script to download and extract University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection graphs in a directory.

### Reporting bugs and contributing ###

If you find any bugs please report them by using the repository (github **issues** panel).
We are also ready to engage in improving and extending the framework if you request some new features.
