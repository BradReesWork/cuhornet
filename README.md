# cuSTINGER #

## Getting Started ##

The document is organized as follows:

* Requirements
* Supported graph formats
* Quick start
* Notes
* Additional Utilities
* Reporting bugs and contributing
* Acknowledgements
* License

The syntax and the input parameters of cuSTINGER are explained in details in the `Syntax.txt` file or by typing `./cuStingerTest --help`.

The code documentation is located in the `doc` directory (*doxygen* html format).
The documentation is also accessible online at this [**link**.](https://federicounivr.github.io/cuStinger/)

### Requirements ###

* NVIDIA Modern GPU (compute capability > 3.0): Maxwell, Pascal architectures.
* CUDA toolkit v7.5 or greater. (CUDA toolkit v8.0 recommended, CUDA toolkit v7.0 supported but not tested)

* GCC or Clang host compiler with support for C++11.
* CMake v3.5 or greater.

### Supported graph formats ###

cuSTINGER supports the following graph input formats:

* Market (.mtx), [The University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection](http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/matrices/)
* Metis (.graph), [10th DIMACS Implementation Challenge](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/dimacs10/)
* SNAP (.txt), [Stanford Network Analysis Project](http://snap.stanford.edu/)
* Dimacs9th (.gr), [9th DIMACS Implementation Challenge](http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/challenge9/)
* Binary (.bin)
* The Koblenz Network Collection (out.< name >), [The Koblenz Network Collection](http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/)
* Network Data Repository (.edges), [Network Data Repository](http://networkrepository.com/index.php)

cuSTINGER directly deduces the graph structure (directed/undirected) from the input file header.

cuSTINGER allows reading the input graph by using a fixed binary format to speed up the file loading.
The binary file is generated by cuSTINGER with the `--binary` command line option.

### Quick start ###

The following basic steps are required to build and execute cuStinger:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/cuStinger/cuStinger.git
cd cuStinger/build
cmake ..
make -j 6
./cuStingerTest <input_graph> <options>
```
## Notes ##

* The changelog can be fouund in the util directory (history.txt)
* cuSTINGER has been written by adopting (when possible) the following coding styles:
    * LLVM Coding Standards
    * Google C++ Style Guide
* cuSTINGER has been checked with the following tools to ensure the code quality:
    * clang++: warnings
    * clang-tidy: warnings and code styles
* cuSTINGER has been tested with the following tools:
    * cuda-memcheck
    * valgrind
    * clang static analyzer

## Additional Utilities ##

* `utility/count_lines.sh` : some statistics about lines of code used in cuStinger.
* `utility/uf_graph_download.sh` : simple script to download and extract
University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection graphs in a directory.

## Reporting bugs and contributing ##

If you find any bugs please report them by using the repository (github **issues** panel).
We are also ready to engage in improving and extending the framework if you request some new features.

Additional information on cuSTINGER can be found in the [HPEC'16 conference paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308174457_cuSTINGER_Supporting_Dynamic_Graph_Algorithms_for_GPUs).
